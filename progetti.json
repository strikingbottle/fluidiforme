An area between the bend of the Tevere and the slopes of Monte Mario, where the traces of a complex urban development have settled, as in a palimpsest defined by André Corboz: the area’s twentieth-century industrial tradition interfaces with works of contemporary architecture, such as the MAXXI by Zaha Hadid, the Palazzetto dello Sport by Nervi, the Auditorium by Piano and the Great MAXXI by LAN studio. \n\nAware of intervening in a context rich in history but inclined towards a new urbanism defined by the masterplan of the Viganò studio, our design process arose from a careful and critical reading of those traces left by past interventions and by the regulatory principles of those to come, in order to trace the genius loci of the Flaminio district."

To the south, there are modernist li-near blocks, with five floors above ground and a strong horizontal organization. To the east, large industrial buildings (factory box), introverted, that do not communi¬cate with the city around.\n\nThe idea of the project stems from the desire to maintain the genius loci of the area, reinterpreting the morphologies that already exist on the context, organizing the Super Block around the lake and connecting it to the urban paths."

This contrast highlights the concept of duality and change.\n\nRaw Cloud can serve as a meeting point between individuals, encouraging human conversations and interactions. In its role as home furnishings, it can facilitate moments of sharing and social connection, providing a shared space for experience and contemplation, which is reflected in its very essence of uniting materiality and concept."

    "testo": "'Tetralogia Urbana' investigates the relationship between the design of affordable cooperative living and the city system, exploring the role of public space in defining strategies capable of generating urbanity.\n\nThe new complex opens up to the city, tracing an unprecedented diagonal axis that connects the Battaglia Canal with the tram line on Via Santa Maria Assunta, passing through the churchyard. This urban gesture connects the lot to the city on a small scale and, on a large scale, links it to Padua's infrastructure and natural heritage.\n\nThe diagonal designs and connects a 'tetralogy' of squares with different geometries, functions, and material treatments: the arena, Piazza Bassanello, the churchyard, and the flânerie. Rethinking the relationship between living and the city (polis) allows us to give a piece back to the people of Padua, thus restoring the right to the city (H. Lefebvre)."

    "testo": "The typical courtyard morphology of the Turin grid, introverted and closed, gives way to a system that is open and accessible to the entire community. Drawing on the post-modern theories of Camillo Sitte and Christian de Portzamparc, the emotional and positive character of dense European urban fabrics emerges from the creation of public spaces that are both defined and open.\n\nFrom this interpretation of the city, an extremely porous ground floor is generated, open to the city and inviting citizens to pass through, connecting the southern urban front with the green area to the north. The public ground floor consists of two opposing buildings: to the east, the restored pre-existing structure; to the west, a newly constructed triangular building that defines the diagonal of the courtyard."
