This urban gesture connects the lot to the city on a small scale and, on a large scale, links it to Padua's infrastructure and natural heritage.\n\nThe diagonal designs and connects a 'tetralogy' of squares with different geometries, functions, and material treatments: the arena, Piazza Bassanello, the churchyard, and the fl√¢nerie. Rethinking the relationship between living and the city (polis) allows us to give a piece back to the people of Padua, thus restoring the right to the city (H. Lefebvre).",

The modular steel structure, the facades in glass and polycarbonate, integrated with photovoltaic panels and LED screens, contribute to the rhetoric of the new addition which, while taking up shapes and proportions from the historic building, differs in its finishes.",

Thus, the design and massing, with the setback and twist of the block, stem from the desire to maximize the southern front and the visual connection between the interiors and the sea, ensuring a window towards the sea to everyone.\nLarge cantilevering terraces define the southern front, while the northern front, in relation to the mountains behind, is marked by smaller openings and the distribution systems.",
